hello_file.xcf is the GIMP source and is ignored by intellij
hello_file.png is the icon referenced by hellolang.HelloFileType
hello_file@2x.png is a larger version of hello_file.png. It's not referenced anywhere in the code and I'm not sure if
IntelliJ ever picks up on it, but I've seen it in other plugins.
