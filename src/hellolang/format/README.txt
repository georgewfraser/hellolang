Format takes the ASTNode objects generated by HelloPsiParser and defines indentation, wrapping, and alignment
rules for each node.

Unlike the PSI tree the is generated by HelloParserDefinition, the Block tree must include all tokens.
For example, the PSI tree ignores the keywords: `let [x] = ["foo"] in [x]`
But the Block tree includes them: `[let] [x] [=] ["foo"] [in] [x]`
